I used Codeblocks 13.12 with mingw compiler (the one that is a 100mb download).
To enter custom text, paste 'main c++ console array maker.cpp' in a console C++ project
and then build. Find the project folder with array maker.exe in explorer.
Create a text file specifically named 'sample.txt' in the same folder.
Type or paste data in the 'sample.txt' text file. Save text file,
close window, then run array maker.exe. 

A file named double arrays.txt should appear in the same folder as array maker.exe .
Create an OpenGL C project and paste the contents 'main opengl xcon.c' in main.c .
Open double arrays.txt , press Select All, then press Copy. Highlight array1,
pointsarray, maxchar0, array2, and array3 declarations in XCON and then paste
the data of double arrays.txt over them from your clipboard. Select Build on the
menu bar on the top of the screen, then 'Build and Run'. XCON should appear with custom text.
